<h2>Financial Indicators (Technical Indicators) 💸</h2>
<p>
Technical indicators are used by traders to gain insight into the supply and demand of securities and market psychology. Together, these indicators form the basis of technical analysis. Metrics, such as trading volume, provide clues as to whether a price move will continue. In this way, indicators can be used to generate buy and sell signals. In this list, you'll learn about seven technical indicators to add to your trading toolkit.

<h2><b>This Trading View Library consist of the following Technical Indicators.🏦</b></h2>
<ol>
<li>24-HR Volume 📈</li>
<p>Volume is the total amount of assets traded in a specific period of time. The 24-hour Volume indicator is used to measure the total volume of a symbol traded in the last 24 hours, expressed as in currency. It can be used to measure the market's interest in a particular symbol.
</p>

<li>Accumulation-Distribution 📈</li>
<p>The accumulation/distribution indicator (A/D) is a cumulative indicator that uses volume and price to assess whether a stock is being accumulated or distributed. The A/D measure seeks to identify divergences between the stock price and the volume flow. This provides insight into how strong a trend is. If the price is rising but the indicator is falling, then it suggests that buying or accumulation volume may not be enough to support the price rise and a price decline could be forthcoming.</p>

<li>Advance Decline Line 📈</li>
<p>The advance/decline line (or A/D line) is a technical indicator that plots the difference between the number of advancing and declining stocks on a daily basis. The indicator is cumulative, with a positive number being added to the prior number, or if the number is negative it is subtracted from the prior number.</p>

<li>Advance Decline Ratio 📈</li>
<p>The advance-decline ratio (ADR) is a popular market-breadth indicator used in technical analysis. It compares the number of stocks that closed higher against the number of stocks that closed lower than their previous day's closing prices. To calculate the advance-decline ratio, divide the number of advancing shares by the number of declining shares. </p>

<li>Arnaud-Legoux Moving Average 📈</li>
<p>The Arnaud Legoux Moving Average calculation is based on a weighted sum using a specified time period, the Gaussian filter offset and a standard deviation. As the average is applied from left to right and right to left, it creates a combo line that the standard deviation sharpens.</p>

<li>Aroon 📈</li>
<p>The Aroon indicator is a technical indicator that is used to identify trend changes in the price of an asset, as well as the strength of that trend. In essence, the indicator measures the time between highs and the time between lows over a time period. The idea is that strong uptrends will regularly see new highs, and strong downtrends will regularly see new lows. The indicator signals when this is happening, and when it isn't.</p>

<li>Average Day Range 📈</li>
<p>The Average Daily Range is a technical indicator used to measure volatility in an asset. It calculates the average difference between the highest and lowest price over a time interval. Typically, this indicator is used to signal a significant change in price action over the short term.</p>

<li>Average Directional Index 📈</li>
<p>The average directional index (ADX) is a technical analysis indicator used by some traders to determine the strength of a trend.
The trend can be either up or down, and this is shown by two accompanying indicators, the negative directional indicator (-DI) and the positive directional indicator (+DI). Therefore, the ADX commonly includes three separate lines. These are used to help assess whether a trade should be taken long or short, or if a trade should be taken at all.</p>

<li>Average True Range 📈</li>
<p>The average true range (ATR) is a technical analysis indicator, introduced by market technician J. Welles Wilder Jr. in his book New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems, that measures market volatility by decomposing the entire range of an asset price for that period.
The true range indicator is taken as the greatest of the following: current high less the current low; the absolute value of the current high less the previous close; and the absolute value of the current low less the previous close. The ATR is then a moving average, generally using 14 days, of the true ranges.</p>

<li>Awesome Oscillator 📈</li>
<p>The Awesome Oscillator Indicator (AO) is a technical analysis indicator created by American trader Bill Williams as a tool to determine whether bullish or bearish forces dominate the market. It measures the market momentum with the aim of detecting potential trend direction or trend reversals. The market momentum is evaluated using a combination of a shorter time frame and longer time frame simple moving averages; in other words, it considers the recent momentum in comparison with a higher frame momentum.</p>
