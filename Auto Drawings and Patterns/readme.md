<h2>Chart Patterns and Drawings ✍🏻</h2>
<p>
In technical analysis, transitions between rising and falling trends are often signaled by price patterns. By definition, a price pattern is a recognizable configuration of price movement that is identified using a series of trendlines and/or curves.

When a price pattern signals a change in trend direction, it is known as a reversal pattern; a continuation pattern occurs when the trend continues in its existing direction following a brief pause.

Technical analysts have long used price patterns to examine current movements and forecast future market movements.
