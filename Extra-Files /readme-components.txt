//This has list of All Technical Indicators

<h2><b>This Trading View Library consist of the following Technical Indicators.🏦</b></h2>
<ol>
<li>24-HR Volume 📈</li>
<p>Volume is the total amount of assets traded in a specific period of time. The 24-hour Volume indicator is used to measure the total volume of a symbol traded in the last 24 hours, expressed as in currency. It can be used to measure the market's interest in a particular symbol.
</p>

<li>Accumulation-Distribution 📈</li>
<p>The accumulation/distribution indicator (A/D) is a cumulative indicator that uses volume and price to assess whether a stock is being accumulated or distributed. The A/D measure seeks to identify divergences between the stock price and the volume flow. This provides insight into how strong a trend is. If the price is rising but the indicator is falling, then it suggests that buying or accumulation volume may not be enough to support the price rise and a price decline could be forthcoming.</p>

<li>Advance Decline Line 📈</li>
<p>The advance/decline line (or A/D line) is a technical indicator that plots the difference between the number of advancing and declining stocks on a daily basis. The indicator is cumulative, with a positive number being added to the prior number, or if the number is negative it is subtracted from the prior number.</p>

<li>Advance Decline Ratio 📈</li>
<p>The advance-decline ratio (ADR) is a popular market-breadth indicator used in technical analysis. It compares the number of stocks that closed higher against the number of stocks that closed lower than their previous day's closing prices. To calculate the advance-decline ratio, divide the number of advancing shares by the number of declining shares. </p>

<li>Arnaud-Legoux Moving Average 📈</li>
<p>The Arnaud Legoux Moving Average calculation is based on a weighted sum using a specified time period, the Gaussian filter offset and a standard deviation. As the average is applied from left to right and right to left, it creates a combo line that the standard deviation sharpens.</p>

<li>Aroon 📈</li>
<p>The Aroon indicator is a technical indicator that is used to identify trend changes in the price of an asset, as well as the strength of that trend. In essence, the indicator measures the time between highs and the time between lows over a time period. The idea is that strong uptrends will regularly see new highs, and strong downtrends will regularly see new lows. The indicator signals when this is happening, and when it isn't.</p>

<li>Average Day Range 📈</li>
<p>The Average Daily Range is a technical indicator used to measure volatility in an asset. It calculates the average difference between the highest and lowest price over a time interval. Typically, this indicator is used to signal a significant change in price action over the short term.</p>

<li>Average Directional Index 📈</li>
<p>The average directional index (ADX) is a technical analysis indicator used by some traders to determine the strength of a trend.
The trend can be either up or down, and this is shown by two accompanying indicators, the negative directional indicator (-DI) and the positive directional indicator (+DI). Therefore, the ADX commonly includes three separate lines. These are used to help assess whether a trade should be taken long or short, or if a trade should be taken at all.</p>

<li>Average True Range 📈</li>
<p>The average true range (ATR) is a technical analysis indicator, introduced by market technician J. Welles Wilder Jr. in his book New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems, that measures market volatility by decomposing the entire range of an asset price for that period.
The true range indicator is taken as the greatest of the following: current high less the current low; the absolute value of the current high less the previous close; and the absolute value of the current low less the previous close. The ATR is then a moving average, generally using 14 days, of the true ranges.</p>

<li>Awesome Oscillator 📈</li>
<p>The Awesome Oscillator Indicator (AO) is a technical analysis indicator created by American trader Bill Williams as a tool to determine whether bullish or bearish forces dominate the market. It measures the market momentum with the aim of detecting potential trend direction or trend reversals. The market momentum is evaluated using a combination of a shorter time frame and longer time frame simple moving averages; in other words, it considers the recent momentum in comparison with a higher frame momentum.</p>

<li>Balance of Power 📈</li>
<p>The Balance of Power (BOP) indicator uses price to measure buying and selling pressure. It determines the strength of the buyers and sellers by looking at how strongly the price has changed, rather than using volume.</p>

<li>Bollinger Bands Width 📈</li>
<p>The Bollinger Band Width is the difference between the upper and the lower Bollinger BandsOpens in a new window divided by the middle band. This technical indicator provides an easy way to visualize consolidation before price movements (low bandwidth values) or periods of higher volatility (high bandwidth values). The Bollinger Band Width uses the same two parameters as the Bollinger Bands: a simple moving- average period (for the middle band) and the number of standard deviations by which the upper and lower bands should be offset from the middle band.</p>

<li>Bollinger Bands 📈</li>
<p>A Bollinger Band® is a technical analysis tool defined by a set of trendlines plotted two standard deviations (positively and negatively) away from a simple moving average (SMA) of a security's price, but which can be adjusted to user preferences.
Bollinger Bands® were developed and copyrighted by famous technical trader John Bollinger, designed to discover opportunities that give investors a higher probability of properly identifying when an asset is oversold or overbought.
</p>

<li>Bull/Bear Power 📈</li>
<p>Bull power rises when bulls are stronger and falls when they are weaker, even becoming negative when they are utterly weak.
Bear power, by contrast, is the capacity of bears to push prices below the moving average. The distance between the low and the EMA, which widens when the bears are weaker and narrows when they are stronger, gives this figure. Bear power is typically negative, so if it turns positive, the bulls have taken complete control.</p>

<li>Chaikin Money Flow 📈 </li>
<p>The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) is an indicator created by Marc Chaikin in the 1980s to monitor the accumulation and distribution of a stock over a specified period. The default CMF period is 21 days. The indicator readings range between +1 and -1. Any crosses above or below 0 can be used to identify changes in money flow, as well as buying or selling momentum.</p>

<li>Chaikin Oscillator 📈</li>
<p>The Chaikin oscillator generates a bullish divergence when it crosses above a baseline. The baseline is called the accumulation-distribution line. A cross above that line indicates that traders are accumulating, which is typically bullish.
The Chaikin oscillator utilizes two primary buy and sell signals. </p>

<li>Chande Kroll Stop 📈</li>
<p>The Chande Kroll Stop is an indicator that calculates average stop-loss and take-profit prices for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other altcoins. The indicator can be used on the 1M, 1W, 1D, 6H, and short-term charts. It uses two lines: Red and green to signify the average stop-loss and take-profit limits.</p>

<li>Chande Momentum Oscillator 📈</li>
<p>The Chande momentum oscillator is a technical momentum indicator introduced by Tushar Chande in his 1994 book The New Technical Trader. The formula calculates the difference between the sum of recent gains and the sum of recent losses and then divides the result by the sum of all price movements over the same period.</p>

<li>Chop Zone 📈</li>
<p>The Chop Zone indicator is a technical indicator that confirms trendiness or sideways movement in the price of Bitcoin (BTC). Crypto can only go three ways: Up, down, and sideways. Up and down are “trending” movements and sideways is a “choppy” movement. The Chop Zone indicator visually highlights when the price goes sideways.</p>

<li>Choppiness Index 📈</li>
<p>The Choppiness Index is a volatility indicator developed by Australian commodity trader Bill Dreiss to indicate whether a market is trending or ranging. Values range between 0 and 100, with low values indicating a strong trend and high values signaling consolidation.</p>

<li>Commodity Channel Index 📈</li>
<p>The Commodity Channel Index​ (CCI) is a momentum-based oscillator used to help determine when an investment vehicle is reaching a condition of being overbought or oversold.
Developed by Donald Lambert, this technical indicator assesses price trend direction and strength, allowing traders to determine if they want to enter or exit a trade, refrain from taking a trade, or add to an existing position. In this way, the indicator can be used to provide trade signals when it acts in a certain way.</p>

<li>Connors RSI 📈</li>
<p>Connors RSI (CRSI) is a technical analysis indicator created by Larry Connors that is actually a composite of three separate components. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), developed by J. Welles Wilder, plays an integral role in Connors RSI. In fact, Wilder's RSI is used in two of the indicator's three components. The three components; The RSI, UpDown Length, and Rate-of-Change, combine to form a momentum oscillator. Connors RSI outputs a value between 0 and 100, which is then used to identify short-term overbought and oversold conditions.</p>

<li>Coppock Curve 📈</li>
<p>The Coppock Curve is a long-term price momentum indicator used primarily to recognize major downturns and upturns in a stock market index. It is calculated as a 10-month weighted moving average of the sum of the 14-month rate of change and the 11-month rate of change for the index. It is also known as the "Coppock Guide."</p>

<li>Cumulative Volume Index 📈</li>
<p>The cumulative volume index, or CVI, is a momentum indicator that gauges the movement of funds into and out of the entire stock market by computing the difference between advancing and declining stocks as a running total.</p>

<li>Detrended Price Oscillator 📈</li>
<p>The detrended price oscillator (DPO) is an indicator in technical analysis that attempts to eliminate the long-term trends in prices by using a displaced moving average so it does not react to the most current price action. This allows the indicator to show intermediate overbought and oversold levels effectively.</p>

<li>Directional Movement Index 📈</li>
<p>The directional movement index (DMI) is an indicator developed by J. Welles Wilder in 1978 that identifies in which direction the price of an asset is moving. The indicator does this by comparing prior highs and lows and drawing two lines: a positive directional movement line (+DI) and a negative directional movement line (-DI). An optional third line, called the average directional index (ADX), can also be used to gauge the strength of the uptrend or downtrend.</p>

<li>Divergence Indicator 📈</li>
<p>Divergence is when the price of an asset is moving in the opposite direction of a technical indicator, such as an oscillator, or is moving contrary to other data. Divergence warns that the current price trend may be weakening, and in some cases may lead to the price changing direction.</p>

<li>Donchian Channels 📈</li>
<p>Donchian Channels are three lines generated by moving average calculations that comprise an indicator formed by upper and lower bands around a midrange or median band. The upper band marks the highest price of a security over N periods while the lower band marks the lowest price of a security over N periods.</p>

<li>Double EMA 📈</li>
<p>The double exponential moving average (DEMA) is a technical indicator that was devised to reduce the lag in the results produced by a traditional moving average. Technical traders use it to lessen the amount of "noise" that can distort the movements on a price chart.</p>

<li>Ease of Movement 📈</li>
<p>The Ease of Movement indicator shows the relationship between price and volume, and it's often used to assess the strength of an underlying trend. Ease of Movement calculates how easily a price can move up or down.
</p>

<li>Elders Force Index 📈</li>
<p>The Elder Force Index indicator is used to measure the power driving a movement in the price. It tries to highlight potential price reversals and corrections by analyzing the direction, length, and volume driving the price movement.</p>

<li>Envelope 📈</li>
<p>The Envelopes indicator is a tool that attempts to identify the upper and lower bands of a trading range. It does this by plotting two moving average envelopes on a price chart, one shifted up to a certain distance above the price and the other shifted below.</p>

<li>Fisher Transform 📈</li>
<p>The Fisher Transform is a technical indicator created by John F. Ehlers that converts prices into a Gaussian normal distribution.1 The indicator highlights when prices have moved to an extreme, based on recent prices. This may help in spotting turning points in the price of an asset. It also helps show the trend and isolate the price waves within a trend.</p>

<li>Historical Volatility 📈</li>
<p>Historical volatility (HV) is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index over a given period of time. Generally, this measure is calculated by determining the average deviation from the average price of a financial instrument in the given time period.</p>

<li>Hull Moving Average 📈</li>
<p>The Hull Moving Average (HMA), developed by Alan Hull, is an extremely fast and smooth moving average. In fact, the HMA almost eliminates lag altogether and manages to improve smoothing at the same time.</p>

<li>Ichimoku Cloud 📈</li>
<p>The Ichimoku Cloud is a type of chart used in technical analysis to display support and resistance, momentum, and trend in one view. TenkanSen and KijunSen are similar to moving averages and analyzed in relationship to one another.</p>

<li>Keltners Channels 📈</li>
<p>Keltner Channels are volatility-based bands that are placed on either side of an asset's price and can aid in determining the direction of a trend.
The Keltner channel uses the average-true range (ATR) or volatility, with breaks above or below the top and bottom barriers signaling a continuation.</p>

<li>Klinger Oscillator 📈</li>
<p>The Klinger oscillator was developed by Stephen Klinger to determine the long-term trend of money flow while remaining sensitive enough to detect short-term fluctuations. The indicator compares the volume flowing through securities with the security's price movements and then converts the result into an oscillator.</p>

<li>Know Sure thing 📈</li>
<p>The Know Sure Thing (KST) is a momentum oscillator intended to interpret rate-of-change price data. Trading signals are generated when the KST crosses over the signal line, but traders also look for overbought or oversold conditions.</p>

<li>Least Squares Moving Average 📈</li>
<p>The least square moving average (LSMA) calculates the least squares regression line for the preceding time periods, thus leading to forward projections from the current period. Accordingly, the indicator has the ability to identify what could happen if the regression line continued.</p>

<li>Linear Regression Channel 📈</li>
<p>The Linear Regression Channel is a three-line technical indicator used to analyze the upper and lower limits of an existing trend. Linear regression is a statistical tool used to predict the future from past data. It is used to determine when prices may be overextended.</p>

<li>MA Cross 📈</li>
<p>In the statistics of time series, and in particular the stock market technical analysis, a moving-average crossover occurs when, on plotting two moving averages each based on different degrees of smoothing, the traces of these moving averages cross. It does not predict future direction but shows trends.</p>

<li>Mass Index 📈</li>
<p>The mass index is an indicator, developed by Donald Dorsey, used in technical analysis to predict trend reversals. It is based on the notion that there is a tendency for reversal when the price range widens, and therefore compares previous trading ranges (highs minus lows).</p>

<li>Mc Ginley Dynamic 📈</li>
<p>The McGinley Dynamic indicator is a type of moving average that was designed to track the market better than existing moving average indicators. It is a technical indicator that improves upon moving average lines by adjusting for shifts in market speed. John R. McGinley, a market technician, is the inventor of the eponymous indicator.</p>

<li>Median 📈</li>
<p>The Median Price indicator is simply the midpoint of each day's price. The Typical Price and Weighted Close are similar indicators. The Median Price indicator provides a simple, single-line chart of the day's "average price." This average price is useful when you want a simpler view of prices.</p>

<li>Momentum 📈</li>
<p>Momentrum indicators are technical analysis tools used to determine the strength or weakness of a stock's price. Momentum measures the rate of the rise or fall of stock prices. Common momentum indicators include the relative strength index (RSI) and moving average convergence divergence (MACD).</p>

<li>Money Flow Index 📈</li>
<p>The Money Flow Index (MFI) is a technical oscillator that uses price and volume data for identifying overbought or oversold signals in an asset. It can also be used to spot divergences which warn of a trend change in price. The oscillator moves between 0 and 100.
Unlike conventional oscillators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), the Money Flow Index incorporates both price and volume data, as opposed to just price. For this reason, some analysts call MFI the volume-weighted RSI.
</p>

<li>Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) 📈</li>
<p>Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security's price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA.</p>

<li>Moving Average Exponential 📈</li>
<p>The exponential moving average (EMA) is a technical chart indicator that tracks the price of an investment (like a stock or commodity) over time. The EMA is a type of weighted moving average (WMA) that gives more weighting or importance to recent price data.</p>

<li>Moving Average Ribbon 📈</li>
<p>A moving average ribbon is a connected series of sequential moving averages. The trader determines how many MAs are used to create the ribbon, as well as the lookback periods (length) of each ribbon. When the price is above the MA ribbon, and the MAs are angled upwards, it helps confirm a rising price.</p>

<li>Moving Average Weighted 📈</li>
<p>A Weighted Moving Average puts more weight on recent data and less on past data. This is done by multiplying each bar's price by a weighting factor. Because of its unique calculation, WMA will follow prices more closely than a corresponding Simple Moving Average.</p>

<li>Moving Average 📈</li>
<p>A moving average is a statistic that captures the average change in a data series over time. In finance, moving averages are often used by technical analysts to keep track of prices trends for specific securities.</p>

<li>Multi-Time Period Charts 📈</li>
<p>In specializing as a day trader, momentum trader, breakout trader or event risk trader, among other styles, many market participants lose sight of the larger trend, miss clear levels of support and resistance and overlook high probability entry and stop levels. In this article, we will describe what multiple time frame analysis is and how to choose the various periods and how to put it all together.</p>

<li>Net Volume 📈</li>
<p>Net volume is a technical indicator calculated by subtracting a security's uptick volume by its downtick volume over a specified period of time. Unlike standard volume, the indicator differentiates whether the market sentiment is leaning bullish or bearish.</p>

<li>On Balance Volume 📈</li>
<p>On Balance Volume (OBV) measures buying and selling pressure as a cumulative indicator that adds volume on up days and subtracts volume on down days. When the security closes higher than the previous close, all of the day's volume is considered up-volume.</p>

<li>Open Interest 📈</li>
<p>Open interest refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts that have not been settled. For each buyer of a futures contract there must be a seller. From the time the buyer or seller opens the contract until the counter-party closes it, that contract is considered 'open'.</p>

<li>Parabolic SAR 📈</li>
<p>The parabolic SAR is a technical indicator used to determine the price direction of an asset, as well as draw attention to when the price direction is changing. Sometimes known as the "stop and reversal system," the parabolic SAR was developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr., creator of the relative strength index (RSI).</p>

<li>Pivot Points (High/Low) 📈</li>
<p>Pivot Points (High/Low), also known as Bar Count Reversals, are used to anticipate potential price reversals. Pivot Point Highs are determined by the number of bars with lower highs on either side of a Pivot Point High.</p>

<li>Pivot Points Standard 📈</li>
<p>Pivot Points Standard is a technical indicator that is used to determine the levels at which price may face support or resistance. The Pivot Points indicator consists of a pivot point (PP) level and several support (S) and resistance (R) levels.
</p>

<li>Price Oscillator 📈</li>
<p>The percentage price oscillator (PPO) is a technical momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages in percentage terms. The moving averages are a 26-period and 12-period exponential moving average (EMA).</p>

<li>Rate of Change 📈</li>
<p>Rate of change is used to mathematically describe the percentage change in value over a defined period of time, and it represents the momentum of a variable. The calculation for ROC is simple in that it takes the current value of a stock or index and divides it by the value from an earlier period.</p>

<li>Relative Strength Index 📈</li>
<p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI), developed by J. Welles Wilder, is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. The RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Traditionally the RSI is considered overbought when above 70 and oversold when below 30.</p>

<li>Relative Vigor Index 📈</li>
<p>The Relative Vigor Index (RVI) is an oscillator based on the concept that prices tend to close higher than they open in up trends and close lower than they open in down trends. Basically, it is an oscillator that is in phase with the cycle of the underlying's price.</p>

<li>Relative Volatility Index 📈</li>
<p>Relative Volatility Index (RVI) Indicator is a momentum oscillator, which measures both the speed as well as the rise or fall of price movements of a stock in terms of complete stock trading. Relative Volatility Index (RVI) Indicator is one of the top Technical Analysis Indicator.</p>

<li>SMI Ergodic Indicator 📈</li>
<p>The SMI Ergodic Indicator is the same as the True Strength Index (TSI) developed by William Blau, except the SMI includes a signal line. The SMI uses double moving averages of price minus previous price over 2 time frames. The signal line, which is an EMA of the SMI, is plotted to help trigger trading signals.</p>

<li>SMI Erogdic Oscillator 📈</li>
<p>SMI Ergodic is calculated the same as the True Strength Index except it is a double-smoothed. It also includes a signal line (in purple below) that is an exponential moving average of the SMI Ergodic plot (in orange below). Similar to Stochastics but absent the compression seen with stochastics at extremes. The Ergodic indicator helps identify long trends in prices. As with most oscillators, the overbought or oversold extremes are considered the signal areas.</p>

<li>Stochastic RSI 📈</li>
<p>The Stochastic RSI (StochRSI) is an indicator used in technical analysis that ranges between zero and one (or zero and 100 on some charting platforms) and is created by applying the Stochastic oscillator formula to a set of relative strength index (RSI) values rather than to standard price data.</p>

<li>Stochastic 📈</li>
<p>The stochastic oscillator, also known as stochastic indicator, is a popular trading indicator​ that is useful for predicting trend reversals. It also focuses on price momentum and can be used to identify overbought and oversold levels in shares, indices, currencies and many other investment assets.</p>

<li>SuperTrend 📈</li>
<p>A 'Supertrend' indicator is one, which can give you precise buy or sell signal in a trending market. As the name suggests, 'Supertrend' is a trend-following indicator just like moving averages and MACD (moving average convergence divergence). It is plotted on prices and their placement indicates the current trend.</p>

<li>Technical Ratings 📈</li>
<p>Technical indicators are heuristic or pattern-based signals produced by the price, volume, and/or open interest of a security or contract used by traders who follow technical analysis. By analyzing historical data, technical analysts use indicators to predict future price movements.</p>

<li>Triple EMA 📈</li>
<p>The triple exponential moving average (TEMA) was designed to smooth price fluctuations, thereby making it easier to identify trends without the lag associated with traditional moving averages (MA). It does this by taking multiple exponential moving averages (EMA) of the original EMA and subtracting out some of the lag.</p>

<li>TRIX 📈</li>
<p>Trix is a technical analysis oscillator developed in the 1980s by Jack Hutson, editor of Technical Analysis of Stocks and Commodities magazine. It shows the slope of a triple-smoothed exponential moving average. The name Trix is from "triple exponential."</p>

<li>True Strength Indicator 📈</li>
<p>The true strength index (TSI) is a technical momentum oscillator used to identify trends and reversals. The indicator may be useful for determining overbought and oversold conditions, indicating potential trend direction changes via centerline or signal line crossovers, and warning of trend weakness through divergence.</p>

<li>Ultimate Oscillator 📈</li>
<p>The ultimate oscillator is a theoretical concept in finance developed by Larry Williams as a way to account for the problems experienced in most oscillators when used over different lengths of time.</p>

<li>Up - Down Volume 📈</li>
<p>The Up/Down Volume ratio compares the representation of buyers vs. sellers over a period of time. The assumption is that if a stock closes UP for the day, the attributable volume was induced by buying pressure and thus the stock is under accumulation. Conversely, if a stock closes DOWN for the day, the trading activity is deemed to be selling induced, a sign of distribution.</p>

<li>Volatility Stop 📈</li>
<p>A volatility stop takes a multiple of the ATR, adds or subtracts it from the close, and places the stop at this price. The stop can only move higher during uptrends, lower during downtrends, or sideways. Once the trailing stop has been established, it should never be moved to a worse position.</p>

<li>Volume Oscillator 📈</li>
<p>The Volume Oscillator (VO) works on the technical premise that it is not the actual level of volume, but the change in volume relative to the recent past that has more technical significance. The Volume Oscillator displays the difference between two moving averages of a security's volume expressed as a percentage.</p>

<li>Volume Weighted Average Price 📈</li>
<p>The volume-weighted average price (VWAP) is a measurement that shows the average price of a security, adjusted for its volume. It is calculated during a specific trading session by taking the total dollar value of trading in the security and dividing it by the volume of trades.</p>

<li>Volume Weighted Moving Average 📈</li>
<p>A Volume Weighted Moving Average is a moving average where more weight is given to bars with heavy volume than with light volume. This the value of the moving average will be closer to where most trading actually happened than it otherwise would be without being volume weighted.</p>

<li>Vortex Indicator 📈</li>
<p>A vortex indicator (VI) is an indicator composed of two lines - an uptrend line (VI+) and a downtrend line (VI-). These lines are typically colored green and red respectively. A vortex indicator is used to spot trend reversals and confirm current trends.
</p>

<li>Williams Alligator 📈</li>
<p>The Williams Alligator indicator is a technical analysis tool that uses smoothed moving averages.The indicator uses a smoothed average calculated with a simple moving average (SMA) to start.It uses three moving averages, set at five, eight, and 13 periods. The three moving averages comprise the Jaw, Teeth, and Lips of the Alligator.The indicator applies convergence-divergence relationships to build trading signals, with the Jaw making the slowest turns and the Lips making the fastest turns.</p>

<li>Williams Fractals 📈</li>
<p>The Bill Williams fractal indicator is an indicator that can be used as a standalone tool or in combination with several other indicators. 
Fractals are a natural phenomenon of reversals within reversals. In order for a fractal to form, there needs to be at least five candles. There needs to be a series of five consecutive candles where the middle candle is the highest while the fourth and the fifth candles are lower.</p>

<li>Williams Percent Range 📈</li>
<p>Williams %R, or just %R, is a technical analysis oscillator showing the current closing price in relation to the high and low of the past N days (for a given N). It was developed by a publisher and promoter of trading materials, Larry Williams. Its purpose is to tell whether a stock or commodity market is trading near the high or the low, or somewhere in between, of its recent trading range.</p>

<li>Woodies CCI 📈</li>
<p>Woodies CCI is a Commodity Channel Index based system developed by Ken Woods. The main principle of this system is that the price moves in the direction of CCI.
Zero line is the main indicator of support/resistance. If CCI crosses this level and does not go back for at least six bars, it might indicate trend existence; CCI crossing above zero line signifies the uptrend, if it crosses below, downtrend. Zero line is also merged with LSMA indicator which shows if the price is below or above LSMA (a moving average designed for Woodies CCI). Red areas of the indicator signify that the price is below LSMA; green areas, above.</p>

<li>Zig-Zag 📈</li>
<p>The zig zag indicator is a basic tool that analysts use to find out when a security's trend is reversing. By determining the support and resistance areas, it helps to identify significant changes in price while filtering out short-term fluctuations, thus eliminating the noise of everyday market conditions.</p>
